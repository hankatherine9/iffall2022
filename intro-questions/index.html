    <h2>Introductory questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>My name is Katherine Han, and I am a junior majoring in Communication Design and minoring in Marketing.</li>
        <li>My strongest skill as an artist is illustration, and this course is a requirement for my major. However, I am genuinely interested in learning more about how to code and design a website. Eventually I would like to create my own portfolio website.</li>
        <li>I do not have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS. I have learned a little bit of Java in CSE 131.</li>
        <li>I hope to learn how to make an interactive website with typographic content that reacts and adapts when the viewer interacts with the website and/or browser window.</li>
        <li>Designs on paper are static and do not change size or distort (without permanently altering the material) once they are printed/laid on paper. However, I expect that designing for the screen to be different in the sense that you need to account for changes caused by users interacting with the browser (e.i. decreasing or increasing the browser window width).</li>
        <li>I think the <a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike</a> webiste exemplifies effective design because it follows iconic branding guidelines and has a clean layout of a solid variety of elements (type, group model images, product images, etc).</li>
        <li>I think the <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> webiste exemplifies effective communication because it is clear and easy to navigate. It also still reads well in different window sizes and device/screen sizes.</li>
        <li>I think the <a href="https://groundsforchange.com/">Grounds for Change</a> website works well because it is plainly lists exactly what it sells and why without being overly complicated.</li>
    </ol>
